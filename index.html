    <h2>The Basic Concept</h2>
    <div class="section-text">
      <p>You control a turtle with a pen tied to its tail.
        When you tell it to move somewhere, it draws the path that it goes through to get there.</p>
      <p>Change the color of the pen, fill shapes, and even use randomness to
        direct the turtle. There are plenty of ways to draw all kinds of
        amazing pictures!</p>
