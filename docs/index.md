## Welcome to the Turtle Library!

This library will allow you to draw animated pictures with the Rust programming
langauge.

**This documentation is still being built. Many of the navigation links on the
left will not work or may break in the future.** In the meantime, the following
resources should help you learn what you need:

* [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/) - If you are new to the Rust programming language
* [Turtle Library Examples](https://github.com/sunjay/turtle/tree/master/examples) - Creative examples of how to use the library for drawing things from basic shapes to colorful masterpieces, and even the logo of the Rust programming language!
  * **How you can help:** Contribute your examples! Open a PR on the GitHub
    repository so we can add your example to the repository for everyone to see!
* [The Turtle Library API Documentation](https://docs.rs/turtle) - Every drawing
  function and most of the rest of the library is well documented
  * **How you can help:** Add examples and better descriptions to the drawing
    functions
